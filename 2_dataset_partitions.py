    Dataset Partitioning Script

    This script partitions a large dataset of paper abstracts into smaller, manageable chunks
    while preserving title-abstract pairs. It implements memory-efficient processing by reading
    and writing data incrementally.

    Key Features:
    - Splits dataset based on system memory constraints (affordance)
    - Preserves title-abstract pair relationships
    - Provides progress logging and preview samples
    - Handles large files through incremental processing

    Input:
    - A text file containing alternating lines of paper titles and abstracts
    - File path expected: paper_dataset/abstracts_v1.txt

    Output: 
    - Multiple text files named 'abstracts_part_v1_N.txt' where N is the partition number
    - Each output file contains complete title-abstract pairs
    - Files are written to the same directory as input

    Memory Management:
    - Uses a configurable 'affordance' parameter to control memory usage
    - Default affordance: 25000 lines per partition
    - Minimum of 4 partitions regardless of file size

    Error Handling:
    - Checks for input file existence
    - Validates pair completeness during processing
    - Handles end-of-file conditions appropriately

    Usage:
        Run directly: python 3_dataset_partitions.py
        Import and call: main_split()

    Dependencies:
        - Python 3.x
        - Standard libraries: os, math, logging
