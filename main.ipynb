In the pandemic context, a methodological change is needed to recover from the ravages, and it is necessary to use methodologies that can minimize losses in industries. The purpose of the bibliography presented and gathered here is to expose the use of lean manufacturing tools for improvement of current systems and processes, revealing the trends of use within the industry, their application in conjunction with these techniques and their combination with methodologies from other areas. The model was validated through a simulation in the Arena software where the results achieved were a reduction in the packaging cycle time from 231.6 to 109.2 sec, the welding time from 69.26 to 65.26 sec, the external delivery delays from 367 to 46 min and internal from 52 to 7 min. Thus, a significant improvement in the level of service from 74% to 87%. This model shows a methodological integration of the differences applied to the Peruvian reality.\n",

      "Comparisons between human and rodent DNA sequences are widely used for the identification of regulatory regions (phylogenetic footprinting), and the importance of such intergenomic comparisons for promoter annotation is expanding. The efficacy of such comparisons for the identification of functional regulatory elements hinges on the evolutionary dynamics of promoter sequences. Although it is widely appreciated that conservation of sequence motifs may provide a suggestion of function, it is not known as to what proportion of the functional binding sites in humans is conserved in distant species. In this report, we present an analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of transcription factor binding sites whose function had been experimentally verified in promoters of 51 human genes and compare their sequence to homologous sequences in other primate species and rodents. Our results show that there is extensive divergence within the nucleotide sequence of transcription factor binding sites. Using direct experimental data from functional studies in both human and rodents for 20 of the regulatory regions, we estimate that 32%-40% of the human functional sites are not functional in rodents. This is evidence that there is widespread turnover of transcription factor binding sites. These results have important implications for the efficacy of phylogenetic footprinting and the interpretation of the pattern of evolution in regulatory sequences.\n",

      "From a theorem of Van Nall it is known that inverse limits with sequences of upper semi-continuous set-valued functions with 0-dimensional values have dimension bounded by the dimensions of the factor spaces. Information is also available about the dimension of inverse limits with sequences of upper semi-continuous continuum-valued bonding functions having graphs that are mappings on the factor spaces that have continua appended at each point of a closed set, however the conclusion of this theorem allows the possibility of an infinite dimensional inverse limit. In this paper we show that inverse limits with sequences of certain surjective upper semi-continuous continuum-valued bonding functions have dimension bounded by the dimensions of the factor spaces. One consequence of our investigation is that certain inverse limits on [0, 1] with upper semi-continuous continuum-valued functions are tree-like including those that are inverse limits on [0, 1] with a single interval-valued bonding function that has no flat spots.\n",

The solution path algorithm is an effective tool for solving a sequence of a parametrized optimization problems in machine learning. The path of the solutions provided by this algorithm are very accurate and they satisfy the optimality conditions more strictly than other SVM optimization algorithms. In many machine learning application, however, this strict optimality is often unnecessary, and it adversely affects the computational efficiency. Our algorithm can generate the path of suboptimal solutions within an arbitrary user-specified tolerance level. It allows us to control the trade-off between the accuracy of the solution and the computational cost. Moreover, We also show that our suboptimal solutions can be interpreted as the solution of a \\emph{perturbed optimization problem} from the original one.

      "Organic and inorganic structure-directing agents (SDAs) impact Al distributions in zeolite, but the insights into how SDAs manipulate Al distribution have not been elucidated yet. Herein, the roles of different SDAs such as cyclohexylamine (CHA), hexamethylenimine (HMI), and Na+ in selective Al substitution of MCM-49 zeolite are investigated comprehensively by multinuclear solid-state NMR. The results demonstrate that MCM-49 synthesized with HMI shows relatively more T6 and T7 Al, while more T2 Al is observed using CHA. The formation of T2 Al in both MCM-49(HMI) and MCM-49(CHA) is derived from Na+, while protonated HMIs show bias in incorporation of T6 and T7 Al. Most HMIs are occluded in protonated status, and about half of CHAs are occluded in nonprotonated status. The close spatial proximity between nonprotonated CHAs and Na+ synergistically promotes the formation of zeolite structure, leading to more Na+ ions occluded in the zeolite channel with preferential T2 Al substitution.\n",

Moreover, the diagnostic efficacy of DKI in PD is not consistent. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to use the method of meta-analysis, to summarize and evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of DKI in the identification of PD, and to explore the value of its clinical application. Methods We use PICOS principles for project design. The included patients were PD patients, and the control group were healthy volunteers. We hope to use DKI to make a differential diagnosis between the two, and this study is a diagnostic test. We performed a literature search of English (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, etc.) and Chinese (China knowledge Network, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service platform, China Science and Technology Journal Database, China Biomedical Literature Service system) databases for related literatures on the efficacy of DKI in the differential diagnosis of PD published before March 29, 2022. We used Revman 5.3 software to assess the quality of the literature, Meta-Disc 1.4 software for summarizing sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), diagnostic odds ratios, and heterogeneity tests, and for subgrouping, and Stata 16.0 software for publication bias analysis. Results Fourteen articles were included through the literature search. The 14 studies included 535 patients with PD and 486 patients without PD. Most of the included literature had good clinical applicability and relatively low risk. By merging statistics, the results obtained were as follows: Sen =0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74–0.81], Spe =0.83 (95% CI: 0.79–0.86), and the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was 0.8870. Discussion The results of the meta-analysis showed that magnetic resonance DKI has comparable diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of PD. However, this study also has limitations, and the use of different diagnostic gold standards in the included studies may have some impact on the case selection in the study.\n",

      "IntroductionIncreasing evidence suggests that acquisition of a variety of different attitudes, skills, and behaviors (or ‘non‐technical content [NTC]’) are core to gross anatomy education, alongside discipline‐based knowledge. Examples of NTC include human ethics, teamwork, and professionalism. Human donors and laboratory experiences typically serve as the foundation of NTC curriculum development and assessment. With many global institutions shifting from in‐person, human dissections to virtual laboratories, in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, we sought to explore anatomists’ views on NTC within this novel virtual environment. MethodsEngaging mixed methods study design, and a pragmatist theoretical lens ‐ a voluntary survey (IU IRB# 2006285000) was developed and distributed internationally from July to November 2020. Additional to demographic information (including information about courses taught), questions about anatomists’ views of the importance, extent and types of NTC relevant to student learning were posed. The context included anatomists’ perceptions of these NTC both prior to and during their pandemic teaching experiences. Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 27. Differences between NTC and their assessment prior to and during the pandemic were compared using paired samples t‐test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Free responses were analyzed using thematic analysis.Results Survey responses (n=82) represented all continents except Antarctica. Pre‐COVID‐19, respondents delivered 12% of their content online which increased to 66% online content delivery during the pandemic. Regarding the NTC, respondents expected students to acquire, only 37% is formally assessed. Overall, there was a significant decrease in the NTC assessment during the pandemic (p=0.001). Greater than 35% of respondents reported assessing the following content pre‐COVID‐19: respect for donors, teamwork, communication, clinical reasoning, and professionalism. During COVID‐19, almost all of these categories significantly decreased in the number of respondents who planned to assess these (p≤ 0.001). Fifty‐five respondents (67%) provided free responses highlighting concerns about acquisition of empathy, respect for donors, and teamwork due to reduced or eliminated dissection. ConclusionAnatomy educators report incorporating strategies into their courses to foster student development of NTC. Acquisition of these important skills remains largely a part of the hidden curriculum based on percentage of respondents assessing them. This percentage further decreased in the virtual environment. Given the availability of formative assessment types we encourage more robust and explicit incorporation into the formal curriculum.\n",

      "The RB1/E2F1 signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in colorectal cancer and has been suggested to intersect with Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt pathways, but molecular evidence for this link is lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that phospholipase D1 (PLD1), a transcriptional target of β-catenin/TCF4, orchestrates functional interactions between these pathways during intestinal tumor development. Overexpression of PLD1 in intestinal epithelial cells protected cells from apoptosis induced by PLD1 ablation in the Apcmin/+ mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that genetic and pharmacologic targeting of PLD1 promote the E2F1-dependent apoptotic program via both miR-192/4465-mediated downregulation of RB1 and inhibition of Akt-TopBP1 pathways. Moreover, the miRNA-RB1 axis and Akt pathway also contributed to the PLD1-mediated self-renewal capacity of colon cancer-initiating cells. Finally, PLD1-driven E2F1 target gene expression positively correlated with tumor stage in patients with colorectal cancer. Overall, our findings suggest that PLD1 mediates cross-talk between multiple major signaling pathways to promote the survival and malignancy of colon cancer cells and may therefore represent an ideal signaling node for therapeutic targeting.

Therefore, it is particularly important to accurately control and detect the content of PPD in our daily products and environment. Here, a small amount of non-metallic elemental P doped in perovskite oxide of SrCoO3−δ (SC) forms a good catalytic material, SrCo0.95P0.05O3−δ (SCP), for PPD detection. The improved performance compared with that of the parent SC can be attributed to three contributing factors, including a larger amount of highly oxidative oxygen species O22−/O−, better electrical conductivity, and more active sites on the P5+-oxygen bonds of SCP. Moreover, the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) with highly active species of lattice O vacancies and adsorbed –OO for electrocatalytic oxidation of PPD by the SCP/GCE (glass carbon electrode) sensor is proposed in our work. More importantly, the SCP/GCE sensor exhibits good stability, a low limit of detection, and high reliability (error < 5.78%) towards PPD determination in real samples of hair dyes, suggesting the substantial research potential for practical applications.\n",

By using ten years'(2014∼2023) historical radiosonde meteorological data at Haikou radiosonde stations, water vapor density profiles are retrieved with the intelligent optimization algorithm named Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) based on high correlation between ZWD and water vapor density profile. The highaccuracy PWV is then integrated by water vapor density profiles.

      "Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) or, more precisely, chronic adult hydrocephalus, is a complex condition. Even if the basic mechanism is found in an impediment to CSF absorption, the underlying pathology is heterogeneous. In secondary NPH, the disruption of normal CSF pathways, following meningitis or sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, is responsible for ventricular dilatation. However, in about half of the cases, the etiology remains obscure. NPH is more frequently found in elderly people, probably in relation with the increased incidence of cerebrovascular disease. The diagnosis of NPH is based upon a triad of clinical symptoms. The main symptom is gait disturbances, followed by urinary incontinence and various degree of cognitive changes. The latter two symptoms are not prerequisites for the diagnosis. Radiological ventricular dilatation without cortical sulcal enlargement is a key factor, as well as substantial clinical improvement after CSF withdrawal (CSF tap test). Other CSF dynamic studies and various imaging investigations have been proposed to improve diagnostic accuracy, but no simple test can predict the results of CSF drainage. The current treatment is ventriculo-peritonial shunting, ideally using an adjustable valve. Results are directly dependent upon the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis.

      "Introduction Von Willebrand disease is the most common bleeding disorder with a prevalence of 1-2% of the population. Nevertheless diagnosis of a von Willebrand Syndrom Typ 1 is still challenging. In a newer publication (1), 30 studies about the haemostatic variables during the menstrual cycle were compared. 11 studies were focused on the von Willebrand parameters but only in one study these parameters in patients with von Willebrand disease were observed. We investigated possible cyclic variations in women with menorrhagia, which can lead to a diagnosis of a coagulation disorder. Samples and Methods We conducted a laboratory workup in 122 women sent to our lab for menorrhagia. The following tests were conducted: Blood count, VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, Fibrinogen (Clauss), activities of FII, FV, FVII, FVIII (clotting and chromogenic), FIX, FX, FXI, FXII, FXIII during the menstrual cycle on predefined time points (day 1-6, day 7-11, day 12-18, day 19-23, day 24-28). Results In 51 (40%) patients a von Willebrand disease could be detected, 37% hat other coagulation disorders like p. e. factor-VII-deficieny and factor-XIII-deficiency. 11.5% had an iron deficiency. In 11.5% no coagulation disorder could be found. In patients with von Willebrand disease we found cyclic variations especially in the VWF:Ag (p = 0.02). They showed the lowest level during the ovulation. For other coagulation parameters no significance for variations during the menstrual cycle were found. Conclusion There are cyclic variations in von Willebrand antigen. To investigate women on predefined time points during the menstrual cycle can be useful to diagnose a von Willebrand disease particularly in mild cases in which no other suspicious bleeding symptoms exists.

I received no pay in cash, nerely board and room for ten months a year, and was sent no bills of any kind-not even for tuition. In return I taught two classes each quarter, mainly freshman or sophomore calculus (with some analytic geometry). Several times I taught a one-quarter course in differential equations, quite elementary, with applications to geometry, physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering. After I got my Ph.D. I remained at Cal Tech for a year as a full-time instructor. That year I taught an honors course in calculus for sophomores. One of by bright students was Edmund Pinney, now on the mathematics faculty at UC Berkeley. I also taught a full year course in differential equations from an excellent book by L. R. Ford. From that experience I learned a great deal that I had never learned before. I found that I greatly enjoyed teaching mathematics. I felt elated after a class meeting at which I sensed my success as a teacher. It was fun to see students catching on to the ideas and techniques of calculus. There was deep satisfaction when I encountered students who began to go ahead rapidly after a doubtful start. And I enjoyed the much deeper understanding I gained as I prepared to teach and worked out my own ideas for the exposition of the material to my classes. I read all the homework and examinations of my students. This was not all pleasure, but it was instructive, for I learned where the students were deficient in understanding and technique, and this helped me to be more effective as a teacher. It was in those years that, without quite realizing where my efforts were taking me, I began to lay the groundwork for my future writing of books on calculus. I did not go overboard in trying to teach elementary calculus as though it were a course in \"baby real variable theory\", but I did begin to think about the theoretical issues in a more critical way than I had ever done before. I think that the shortcoming I minded the most in the most commonly used calculus texts of that day was the failure to be clear in a distinction between the definite integral (as the limit of a sum) and the indefinite integral, or antiderivative (the latter a term not used then much, if at all). There were books that defined the definite integral of f(x) from a to b as F(b) F(a), where F(x) is any function whose derivative is f (x). Osgood's books were not used at Cal Tech. A commonly used book was by Woods and Bailey. A very widely used text of that time was by Granville, Smith, and Longley. It had some merits in problems and narrative, but it had numerous weaknesses in the correct presentation of fundamental concepts and principles. I began to formulate in my mind the notion that, in teaching calculus, the relevant concepts and principles that are needed for a correct and clear treatment should be given recognition at the appropriate places, although not necessarily with the detail and logical completeness needed for full rigor. My doctoral dissertation (1936) was entitled Analytic Functions in General Analysis. It dealt with functions from open sets in the complex plane to a complex Banach space (a subject opened up by Norbert Wiener) and with functions from one complex Banach space to another. A function of the latter sort, defined on an open set, is called locally analytic if it has a Frechet differential at each point, or, alternatively and equivalently, if it is continuous and has a Gateaux differential at each point. I have written expository historical articles about analyticity in functional analysis and operator theory, one in the volume, Problems in Analysis (A Symposium in Honor of Salomon Bochner, Princeton University Press 1970), and one in this MONTHLY, vol. 78, 1971. My interest in analyticity, particularly in connection with the spectral theory of operators, has remained strong all my life.

TAYLOR [December After leaving Cal Tech I spent a postdoctoral year at Princeton University as a National Research Fellow, with a grant of $2000 from the National Research Council. My instructor's salary at Cal Tech had been $1800. At Princeton I had a working relationship with Professor Bochner, some of whose work I had read and admired. We wrote two joint papers. At that time the Princeton Mathematics Department and the mathematicians of the Institute for Advanced Study were all housed together in old Fine Hall. That year I saw a good deal of Ralph Boas, Charles B. Morrey, Anthony P. Morse, Frank Smithies (from England), John Tukey (then a graduate student), and Aurel Wintner (on leave from Johns Hopkins). Bochner was very helpful to me. At first I wasn't sure what to make of him. He seemed rather cynical, and put on a bantering manner with me. At times he was abrupt and sharply critical. It was sometimes hard to interpret him, to distinguish between what was intended as a kind of mocking humor and what was serious criticism, often deserved. There was one time when he at first refused to believe that I was right when I told him that I had discovered that, for an operator-valued function from an open set in the complex plane to the space of bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space, to be strongly analytic (that is, to be analytic as a vector function upon application to each arbitrary vector) is equivalent to being analytic in the uniform topology of the space of operators. But I did convince him. This result of mine was independent of, but roughly contemporaneous with, Nelson Dunford's discovery that, for functions from an open set in the complex plane to a complex Banach space, weak analyticity is equivalent to strong analyticity. During that year at Princeton I first heard of Bourbaki. A great many interesting things were being done by Bourbaki and others in the realm of Banach spaces and topological linear spaces. Boas, Smithies, Tukey, and I used to visit together in old Fine Hall at tea time, talking about what was going on. Much that was new was in the air: various weak topologies, weak compactness of the unit ball in a Banach space, reflexivity,. In the spring of 1938 I was appointed to a second year of the National Research Fellowship. I had barely accepted when I was invited to go to UCLA as an instructor at $2000. I tried unsuccessfully to get the offer held open until the following year. What to do? There were clear advantages in having another year free for research. But I really wanted to have a permanent job in California. This seemed like a fine opportunity, I thought, for although UCLA was not then a prestigious university, its future was bound to be good. I talked to Professors Eisenhart and Veblen. They assured me that the bulk of the best places for work in mathematics in America were on the Atlantic coast, and advised me to keep the fellowship another year. It was a hard choice. I decided on UCLA; everything thereafter vindicated my action, so far as my own life has been\n",

      "The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU) increases awareness of how far the Euroscepticism ideas spread among EU's members. As one of the pivotal EU members, the UK's withdrawal will bring consequences, especially how other countries' members perceived this action. The research focuses on how far the Eurosceptic party's critical ideas are manifested in the European Union treaties. This type of research is descriptive and qualitative. The scope of this research will focus on the Euroscepticism parties and movements in Austria, France, Italy, Netherland, and the United Kingdom. In this study, the authors use the concept of Euroscepticism to explain the classification of parties into the Euroscepticism Hard and Soft category and Neil J. Smelser's Value-Added Collective Behaviour scheme to describe the determinants of their collective action against the European Union. The result of this research is that Euroscepticism spreads throughout Europe by manifesting their critical ideas through six determinants factor, such as structural conduciveness, structural tension, growth, and spread of general beliefs, trigger factors, participant mobility, and social control. The manifestation of critical ideas carried out by Euroscepticism parties in the three countries can be seen through the Single European Act, Maastricht Treaty, Treaty Establishing Constitution for Europe, Referendum British Exit. The culmination of collective action by the Eurosceptic parties was the launch of EU critical campaigns (No to EU!) As well as a significant vote in the EU parliamentary elections.\n",

      "In 2020, 75% of all locally acquired HIV diagnoses will be among gay, bisexual, and other males who have sex with men, indicating that they will continue to be the group in New Zealand most at risk for contracting the virus. Since the peak in 2016 (n=97), the number of MSM reported to have contracted HIV in New Zealand has been declining, with the number in 2020 (n=49) being the lowest since 2011. This is probably because pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and more testing choices are being pushed and made available to this group as combination preventive treatments. Less transmission as a result of COVID-19 physical distancing measures and more restricted testing access will also have contributed to the drop in 2020. It will be crucial to keep an eye on these figures to see if the lower trend persists, as well as to keep up the preventative efforts of routine HIV testing and linking to care and treatment, investigating potential sexually transmitted diseases. In New Zealand in 2020, little over half (54%) of people with heterosexually acquired HIV had a CD4 count at the time of diagnosis that was less than 350 cells/mm3, which was a sign of a delayed diagnosis of their HIV. In addition, six of the 14 patients who received an AIDS diagnosis in 2020 were heterosexually acquired;four of them also received an HIV diagnosis at the same time. Therefore, even if there do not seem to be any obvious risk factors, doctors should test for HIV in patients with similar clinical symptoms. Through antenatal screening in 2020, three women who had recently been diagnosed with HIV were given the opportunity to choose their own medication and care, lowering the chance of mother-to-child transmission. The significance of the antenatal HIV screening program in preventing vertical and secondary transmission is further highlighted by this.\n",

      "—The absence of scientific models, techniques, and work strategies actually applied to small and medium-sized enterprises has been evidenced in the metalworking sector due to the lack of financial support in research and development. In the pandemic context, a methodological change is needed to recover from the ravages, and it is necessary to use methodologies that can minimize losses in industries. The purpose of the bibliography presented and gathered here is to expose the use of lean manufacturing tools for improvement of current systems and processes, revealing the trends of use within the industry, their application in conjunction with these techniques and their combination with methodologies from other areas. The model was validated through a simulation in the Arena software where the results achieved were a reduction in the packaging cycle time from 231.6 to 109.2 sec, the welding time from 69.26 to 65.26 sec, the external delivery delays from 367 to 46 min and internal from 52 to 7 min. Thus, a significant improvement in the level of service from 74% to 87%. This model shows a methodological integration of the differences applied to the Peruvian reality.\n",

      "Comparisons between human and rodent DNA sequences are widely used for the identification of regulatory regions (phylogenetic footprinting), and the importance of such intergenomic comparisons for promoter annotation is expanding. The efficacy of such comparisons for the identification of functional regulatory elements hinges on the evolutionary dynamics of promoter sequences. Although it is widely appreciated that conservation of sequence motifs may provide a suggestion of function, it is not known as to what proportion of the functional binding sites in humans is conserved in distant species. In this report, we present an analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of transcription factor binding sites whose function had been experimentally verified in promoters of 51 human genes and compare their sequence to homologous sequences in other primate species and rodents. Our results show that there is extensive divergence within the nucleotide sequence of transcription factor binding sites. Using direct experimental data from functional studies in both human and rodents for 20 of the regulatory regions, we estimate that 32%-40% of the human functional sites are not functional in rodents. This is evidence that there is widespread turnover of transcription factor binding sites. These results have important implications for the efficacy of phylogenetic footprinting and the interpretation of the pattern of evolution in regulatory sequences.\n",
